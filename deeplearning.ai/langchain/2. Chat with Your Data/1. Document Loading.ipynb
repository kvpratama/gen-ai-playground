       "{'text': \" Welcome to CSP 29 Machine Learning. Uh, some of you know that this class I taught at Stanford for a long time, and this is often the class that, um, I most look forward to teaching each year because this is where we've helped, I think, several generations of Stanford students become experts in machine learning, got out, built many of their products and services and startups that I'm sure many of you, I pray all of you are using, uh, uh, today. Um, so what I want to do today was spend some time talking over, uh, logistics and then, uh, spend some time, you know, giving you a beginning of an intro, talk a little bit about machine learning. So about 229, um, you know, all of you have been reading about AI in the news, uh, about machine learning in the news. Um, and you've probably heard me or others say AI is the new electricity. uh, much as the rise of electricity about 100 years ago transformed every major industry. I think AI or really, we call it machine learning but the rest of the world seems to call it AI. You know, um, machine learning and, and AI and deep learning will change the world. And I hope that through 229, uh, will give you the tools you need so that you can be many of these future titans of industries that you can be one to go out and build, you know, help the large tech companies do the amazing things they do, or build your own startup or go into some other industry, go, go transform healthcare or go transform transportation or go build a self-driving car, um, and do all of these things that, um, after this class I think you'll be able to do. You know, um, the majority of students applying, the, the demand for AI skills, the demand for machine learning skills is so vast. I think you all know that. Um, and I think it's because machine learning has advanced so rapidly in the last few years that there are so many opportunities, um, to apply learning algorithms, right, both in industry as well as in academia. I think today we have, um, the English department professors trying to apply learning algorithms to understand history better. Uh, we have lawyers trying to apply machine learning and to process legal documents. Uh, and off-campus every company, both the tech companies as well as a lot of, a lot of companies that you wouldn't consider tech companies, everything from manufacturing companies to healthcare companies to, there's just six companies are also trying to apply machine learning. So I think that, um, uh, uh, if you look at it on a- on a factual basis, the number of people doing very valuable machine learning projects today is much greater than it was six months ago, and six months ago is much greater than it was 12 months ago. And the amount of value, the amount of exciting meaningful work being done in machine learning is, is, is very strongly going up. Um, and I think that given the rise of, you know, the, the, the amount of data we have as well as the new machine learning tools that we have, um, it will be a long time before we run out of opportunities, you know, before, before society as a whole has enough people with a machine learning skill set. Um, so just as maybe, I don't know, 20 years ago was a good time to start working on this internet thing, and a lot of people that started working on the internet like 20 years ago, had fantastic careers. I think today is a wonderful time to jump to machine learning, uh, and, and, and the number of- and the opportunities for you to do unique things that no one is- no one else is doing, right? The opportunity for you to go to logistics company and find an exciting way to apply machine learning, uh, will be very high because chances are that logistics company has no one else even working on this because, you know, they're probably conned. They, they may not be able to hire a fantastic Stanford student as a graduate of CS229, right? Because there just aren't a lot of CS229 graduates around. Um, so what I want to do today is, um, do a quick intro, talk a little about logistics, um, and then, uh, we'll, we'll spend the second half of the day, you know, giving an overview and, and talk a little bit more about machine learning, okay? And, uh, oh, and I apologize. I, I think that, uh, this room, according to that sign there seats, what, 300 something students? Uh, I think, uh, we have, uh, uh, like, uh, not quite 800 people enrolled in this class. Um, so if there are people outside, and all of the classes are recorded broadcast on the SCPD. Uh, they usually, the videos usually made available same day. So for those of you that can't get into the room, my apologies, um, there were some years, um, where even I had trouble getting into the room, but I'm glad you let me in. Uh, but, but, but hopefully you can watch, you, you better watch all of these things online shortly. Oh, I see. Yes. Yeah. I don't know. Uh, it's a bit complicated. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Thank you. I think it's okay. Yeah. I, I, we could, yeah. Yeah. Maybe for the next few classes, people can squeeze in and use up the NTCs. So for now, it might be too complicated. Uh, okay. So quick intros, um, oh, I'm sorry, I should have introduced myself. My name is Andrew Ng. Uh, uh, and I want to introduce some of the rest of the teaching team as well. As a class coordinator, um, she has been playing this role for many years now and helps, uh, keep the trains run on time and make sure that everything in class happens when it's supposed to. Uh, uh, so, so, so she'll be a- and then, uh, we're thrilled to have- Do you guys want to stand up? Uh, be the co-head TAs, uh, our respective PhD students working with me, uh, and so bring a lot of, um, uh, technical experience, uh, technical experience in machine learning as well as practical know-how on how to actually make these things work. And with the last class that we have, we have a large TA team. Um, maybe I won't introduce all of the TAs here today, but you meet many of them throughout this course here. But the TA's expertise span everything from computer vision to natural language processing, to computer technology, to robotics. And so, um, through this quarter as you work on your class projects, I hope that you get a lot of, uh, help and advice and mentoring from the TAs, uh, all of which- all of whom have deep expertise not just in machine learning, but often in a specific vertical application area, um, of machine learning. So depending on what your projects will try to match you to a TA that can give you advice, uh, uh, that most relevant to whatever project you end up working on. Um, so, you know, go with this class. I hope that after the next 10 weeks, uh, you will be an expert in machine learning. Um, it turns out that, uh, uh, you know, um, and I hope that after this class you'll be able to go out and, uh, build very meaningful machine learning applications, uh, either in an academic setting where, uh, hopefully you can apply it to your problems in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and, uh, English and law and, um, uh, and, and, and education and all of this wonderful work that happens on campus, uh, as well as after you graduate from Stanford to apply to whatever jobs you find. Um, one of the things I find very exciting about machine learning is that, it's no longer a sort of pure tech company only kind of thing, right? I think that many years ago, um, machine learning, it was like a thing that, you know, the computer science department would do, and that the elite AI companies like Google and Facebook and Baidu and Microsoft would do. Uh, but now it is so pervasive that even companies that are not traditional, because the tech companies see a huge need to apply these tools. And I find a lot of the most exciting work, uh, these days. Um, and, and maybe some of you guys know my history, so I'm a little bit biased, right? I, I led the Google Brain Team, which helped Google transform from what was already a great company 10 years ago to today, which is, you know, a great AI company. And then I also led the AI group at Baidu and, you know, led the company's technology and strategy to help Baidu also transform from what was already a great company many years ago to today, arguably China's greatest AI company. So having led the, you know, built the teams that led the AI transformations of two large tech companies, I- I feel like that's a great thing to do. Uh, but even beyond tech, I think that, um, there's a lot of exciting work to do as well to help other industries, to help other sectors, uh, embrace machine learning and use these tools effectively. Um, but after this class, I hope that each one of you will be well-qualified to get a job at, uh, Shiny Tech Company and do machine learning there, or go into one of these other industries and do very valuable machine learning projects there. Um, and in addition, if any of you, um, are taking this class with the primary goal of, uh, being able to do research, uh, in machine learning. You know, so- so actually some of you I know are PhD students. Um, I hope that this class will also leave you well-equipped to, um, really read and understand research papers, uh, as well as, uh, you know, be qualified to start pushing forward, um, the state of the art. Right. Um, so let's see. Um, so today, uh, uh, so- so just as machine learning is evolving rapidly, um, the whole teaching team would've been, uh, constantly updating CS229 as well. So, um, it is actually very interesting. I feel like the pace of progress in machine learning has accelerated. So it, it actually feels like that, uh, the amount we changed the class year over year has been increasing over time. So, so if you're friends that took the class last year, you know, things are a little bit different this year because we're, we're constantly updating the class to keep up with what feels like still accelerating progress in the whole field of machine learning. Um, so- so- so- so there's some logistical changes, for example-\",\n",
